<h2 class="lia-align-center">DevSecOps Defined</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="lia-align-center">Where We Are Now</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">We can all be grateful for the recent developments in cybersecurity involving observability and AI, which have increased visibility and granular control, thus greatly improving threat detection and response. The Shift-left paradigm and the programmability and automation introduced by modern DevOps have facilitated increased security throughout the CI/CD pipeline via automated tests for configuration, compliance, and other factors, therefore reducing the opportunity for human error as well.</font></p>

<p class="lia-align-center">Basic DevOps Lifecycle</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">APIs, often thought of as the most vulnerable attack vector into disrupting microservices-based architectures, have seen increased hardening thanks to initiatives like the open-source tool, <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/api-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API Insights</a>, that Cisco has built to help developers improve API quality and security. This is accomplished through validation and scoring of API specifications as well as trending of API quality with changelog and diff comparisons of AP versions to identify breaking changes.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Cisco&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/application-first-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Application-First Security</a> approach leverages <a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppDynamics</a> with Cisco Secure Application, <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/tetration/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secure Workload</a>&nbsp;(Tetration),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/stealthwatch-cloud/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secure Cloud Analytics</a> (Stealthwatch Cloud), and <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/duo/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco Secure Access by Duo</a> to secure every stage of the application lifecycle. This is implemented across cloud and on-premises deployments, on any workload and integrated into any application.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">These DevOps tools and approach go a very long way toward securing our apps and networks, end-to-end. DevOps also takes us further into Shift-left territory by requiring collaboration between security, development, IT, OT, and other stakeholders; this necessary communication gets the conversation started and has dramatically improved readiness, but, as always, even more is needed. Enter DevSecOps.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="lia-align-center">What&rsquo;s Needed: DevSecOps</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">DevSecOps is an aspect or offshoot of DevOps which facilitates collaboration between the traditionally siloed IT teams mentioned just above. DevSecOps is the practice of baking security into the DevOps Lifecycle and&nbsp;CI/CD&nbsp;pipeline. We&rsquo;ve already discussed how DevOps, by necessity, includes security teams in the SDLC process. DevSecOps, by incorporating DevOps values into software security, ensures security becomes an active, integrated part of the development process, at <em>every </em>step.</font></p>

<p class="lia-align-center">Basic DevSecOps: Continuous Security in the DevOps Lifecycle</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">According to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/devops/devops-tools/devsecops-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlassian</a>, to implement successfully DevSecOps, teams should:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><font size="4">Introduce security throughout the software development lifecycle to minimize vulnerabilities in software code.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Ensure the entire DevOps team, including developers and operations teams, share responsibility for following security best practices.</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Enable automated security checks at each stage of software delivery by integrating security controls, tools, and processes into the DevOps workflow.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">Shift-left is a paradigm and DevOps is the strategic avenue to incorporate security in all aspects of the CI/CD pipeline; tools are the tactical arsenal that will get the job done.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="lia-align-center">DevSecOps Tools</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">Service Mesh, the embodiment of visibility and granular control, is an integral component of DevSecOps, as it helps developers improve security monitoring. <a href="https://calisti.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calisiti</a>, the Cisco service mesh manager, automates lifecycle management and simplifies connectivity, security &amp; observability for microservice based applications.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">New tools have given development teams the ability to chain together interdependent tools and tasks needed to build, test and deliver a working solution.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">These new tools enable:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="lia-list-style-type-disc">
<li><font size="4">automation</font></li>
<li><font size="4">container security</font></li>
<li><font size="4">issue tracking</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Software Composition Analysis&nbsp;(SCA)</font></li>
<li><font size="4">cloud testing</font></li>
<li><font size="4">application security</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Static Application Security Testing (SAST)</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">All these tools are helpful, if not necessary, but can result in a spaghetti monster of complexity that can end up slowing down a SDLC. One way of optimizing testing tools, including deriving meaningful insight from their data, is with an application security orchestration and correlation&nbsp;(ASOC) solution.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">ASOC tools combine the capabilities of&nbsp;application vulnerability correlation (AVC) and application security testing orchestration&nbsp;(ASTO) tools. This provides a management framework for tools, workflows, and prioritization of security activities. An effective ASOC tool is key to DevSecOps because it enables security and development teams to orchestrate testing intelligently, consolidate data from all tools, deduplicate any redundant results, correlate this data based on threat intelligence, and contextualize software risk to prioritize critical findings.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">With DevSecOps, security, via these tools, should be applied to each phase of the typical DevOps lifecycle: plan, build, test, deploy, operate, and observe.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="lia-align-center">Software Factory for DevSecOps</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">While the tools mentioned in the section above are sure to improve efficiency and productivity, they can come with a large amount of overhead themselves. This &lsquo;tool chain tax&rsquo; is best mitigated by putting in place a streamlines software factory. Essentially, this is an end-to-end assembly line of tool consolidation and interaction which makes it easier to manage all the DevSecOps tools for building, testing and delivering our end products.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">You can start building your software factory by identifying the scope, high-level architecture and required security practices (and their degree). Tools will need to be standardized and engineering services will largely be implemented based on the available resources as well as speed of adoption.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Building a software factory is an incremental process and thus takes time and effort, but it can be well worth it. As the architecture and tools are chosen and verified, training will be provided to team members on each tool and pipeline.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">According to &lsquo;<a href="https://learn.gitlab.com/devsecops-aware/building-modern-devsecops-software-factory?_pfses=7prCKwunyqUEahBuJa3z2ob1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building a Modern DevSecOps Software Factory&rsquo;</a> from GitLab, a software factory <em>must</em> address the following:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="lia-list-style-type-disc">
<li><font size="4">Issues &amp; Planning</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Distributed Source Code Management</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Continuous Integration for Every Commit</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Code Reviews &amp; Approvals</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Repository to Manage Binary Assets</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Incremental Deployment</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Continuous Delivery</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Application Monitoring</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Dynamic Test Environments &amp; Infrastructure</font></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="lia-align-center">Lay the Groundwork for DevSecOps in Your Organization</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">Ready to get started and hit the ground running? Follow these recommendations from <a href="https://jfrog.com/devops-tools/what-is-devsecops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JFrog</a> and start laying your DevSecOps groundwork today!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><u>Maturity Action Plan (MAP)</u></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A DevSecOps Maturity Action Plan (MAP) helps your team develop standardized policies for automated security testing and remediation activities in your DevOps workflows</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><u>DevSecOps Culture</u></font></p>
<p><font size="4">A DevSecOps culture is one in which every. single. person. takes responsibility and ownership for security. Taking a cue from DevOps best practices, development teams should assign a volunteer security champion to lead the security and compliance processes in the team in order to elevate the security posture of the processes, products and services therein.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><u>Easily Accessible Data</u></font></p>
<p><font size="4">We&rsquo;re not having fun unless we&rsquo;re funneling pertinent security information straight at the developers. Security needs a greater voice because developers vastly outnumber operations and security professionals. According to <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/devops-security-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Synopsis</a>, that ratio is around 100:10:1.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">By using dedicated&nbsp;IDE plugins, leaders can channel security data straight into the tools developers are already using, facilitating adoption of security-driven best practices. A great example of this is API Insights, from Cisco, mentioned earlier, which has an excellent IDE plugin for VS Code.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><u>Automated Governance</u></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Security checkpoints can be distributed at each phase of the DevOps pipeline to determine if your software can continue to the next phase. A governing system can automatically enforce company policies and be able to take action, accordingly, without human intervention. Examples of automate governance include:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><font size="4">Alerts for security or compliance violations (Webex, Email, Slack, Instant Messages, Jira, etc.)</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Blocking of nefarious downloads</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Failing of builds that depend on vulnerable components or fail to comply with license policies</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Prevention of the deployment of vulnerable release bundles</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><u>Practical Best Practices for DevSecOps</u></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="4">Educate and train developers to develop secure code</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Use automation whenever possible, but do it thoughtfully</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Check the code dependencies</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Track security issues the same as software issues/defects</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Consider a Red Team a Blue Team and Bug Bounties to discover vulnerabilities</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Integrate security controls in the software development pipeline</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Automate security tests in the build process</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Look for known vulnerabilities everywhere in the pipeline</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Inject failure to ensure security is hardened</font></li>
<li><font size="4">Monitor security even after it&rsquo;s in production</font></li>
</ul>
