<h2 align="center">A Source of Truth for  the Cisco Community Engagement Content Calendar, with creation and storage of .txt and MP3 files.</h1>


### What this repository accomplishes

a) Provides a template for your blog or article and showd you how to check it for spelling and grammar errors </br>
b) Shows how to create a directory and .txt file with your article in it </br>
c) An automated workflow will convert the txt file to an MP3 and save it in an 'mp3s' folder in your new directory </br>
d) Explains how to compress your MP3 into a ZIP and attach to your article or blog </br>
e) Gives alternate means of generating your MP3, for more control over spoken accent. </br>

The final result is a .txt source of truth in the relative directory in this repo, along with an MP3. This data structure of blogs and articles serves as a record, backup and can eventually serve as an archive for all artivles on the Cisco Community Developer Hub.


### Step 1


Write your post. If needed, download the [post template](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/community-content-pipeline/blob/main/community-post-template.docx) and adjust as necessary. Use the Spelling and Grammar check, under the Review tab, in MS Word, or do the same in another text editor


### Step 2

A colleague moderator can review the document. A good tool to use, when the document is online, in this repo, in the Community as a draft, etc., is the Grammar & Spell Checker â€” LanguageTool extension for the browser to check for spelling and grammar
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammar-spell-checker-%E2%80%94-l/oldceeleldhonbafppcapldpdifcinji?hl=en-US

If changes need to be made, the moderator will make the changes or the writer will make the changes themself. 


### Step 3


Once all the edits are finished, find the [directory](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/community-content-pipeline/tree/main/developer-hub) where your article/blog will be, and create a folder and new file with a .txt extension. 


<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/xanderstevenson/community-content-pipeline/blob/main/media/create-file.png?raw=true" width=900 /></p>

</br>

Paste your article or blog inside. Delete all URLs, links and any other long strings or numbers, which will not sound good while read out loud.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/xanderstevenson/community-content-pipeline/blob/main/media/add-folder-paste-file.png?raw=true" width=900 /></p>

</br>

At the bottom of the page, comment and commit to the 'main' branch. This will start a workflow to create a folder called 'mp3s' in the same directory and place the mp3 there.

</br>

Now, just download the MP3 from the 'mp3s' folder, compress it into a ZIP file, and attach it to your blog or article post on the Cisco Community!


**In order to attach your MP3 to the blog post or article, you will need to compress it into a ZIP file.**

</br>

### Alternate ways to create your MP3.

* With either way, don't forget to commit your .txt and MP3 files in the repo, to serve as backups.


1. Use [txt_2_mp3](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/txt_2_mp3) - this will give you more control over the accent you want. When it's finished, upload the MP3 to your project folder in the this repo, under developer-hub and don't forget to attach it to your blog/article on the community.

2. Use an online text to MP3 converter and attach the results to you post. Attach it to your blog/article on the Community.


**Remember to In order to attach your MP3 to the blog post or article, you will need to compress it into a ZIP file.**
