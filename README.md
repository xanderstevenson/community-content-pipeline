<h2 align="center">A Source of Truth for  the Cisco Community Engagement, with creation and storage of Text and MP3 files.</h1>


### What this repository accomplishes

**a)** Provides a template for your blog or article and shows you how to check it for spelling and grammar errors </br>
**b)** Shows how to create a directory and upload your clog or article .docx  </br>
**c)** An automated workflow will convert the docx to a txt file and then to an MP3, saving it in an 'mp3s' folder in your new directory. All URLS and empty lines will have been removed, to give your audio a smooth, consistent flow. In the end, you'll have:
- Your original .docx document
- A .txt version of your document
- An MP3, inside of an 'mp3s' sub-folder</br>

**d)** Explains the need to compress your MP3 into a ZIP in order to attach it to your article or blog </br>
**e)** Gives alternate means of generating your MP3, for more control over spoken accent. </br>

The final result is a text source of truth in the relative directory in this repo, along with an MP3. This data structure of blogs and articles serves as a record, backup and can eventually serve as an archive for all artivles on the Cisco Community Developer Hub.


### Step 1


Write your post. If needed, download the [post template](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/community-content-pipeline/blob/main/community-post-template.docx) and adjust as necessary. Use the Spelling and Grammar check, under the Review tab, in MS Word, or do the same in another text editor


### Step 2

A colleague moderator can review the document. A good tool to use, when the document is online, in this repo, in the Community as a draft, etc., is the Grammar & Spell Checker â€” LanguageTool extension for the browser to check for spelling and grammar
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammar-spell-checker-%E2%80%94-l/oldceeleldhonbafppcapldpdifcinji?hl=en-US

If changes need to be made, the moderator will make the changes or the writer will make the changes themself. 


### Step 3


Once all the edits are finished, find the [directory](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/community-content-pipeline/tree/main/developer-hub) where your article/blog will be. 

**Upload your article or blog in .docx format**
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/xanderstevenson/community-content-pipeline/blob/main/media/create-file.png?raw=true" width=900 /></p>

At the bottom of the page, comment and commit to the 'main' branch. This will start a workflow to create a folder called 'mp3s' in the same directory and place the mp3 there.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/xanderstevenson/community-content-pipeline/blob/main/media/comment-commit.png?raw=true" width=500 /></p>

It will first convert the .docx to .txt, removing all images, empty lines and URLs. Then it will convert the .txt to an MP3. You will have your orignal .docx, a .txt. file and the MP3, which will be located in a sub-folder it has created, called 'mp3s', in your new directory. 

</br>

Now, just download the MP3 from the 'mp3s' folder, compress it into a ZIP file, and attach it to your blog or article post on the Cisco Community!



**In order to attach your MP3 to the blog post or article, you will need to compress it into a ZIP file.**

### Alternate ways to create your MP3.
