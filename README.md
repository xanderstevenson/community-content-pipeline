### Step 1

### Step 3

A colleague moderator will review the document. A good tool to use, when the document is online, in this repo, in the Community as a draft, etc., is the Grammar & Spell Checker â€” LanguageTool extension for the browser to check for spelling and grammar

### Step 4

If changes need to be made, the moderator will make the changes themself or the writer will be notified and make the changes themself. 


### Step 5


Once all the edits are finished, find the [directory](https://github.com/xanderstevenson/community-content-pipeline/tree/main/developer-hub) where your article/blog will be, create a folder, add your post, in docx or similar format and commit it, checking 'Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.' The temporary branch, with 'patch' in the name is automatically generated for you.

## Step 6

Now you want to create an MP3 from the post and attach it to the post. There are two ways to do this.

* With either step, you'll need to create a .txt file and paste in your post. Remove all URLs, links and any other long strings or numbers, which will not sound good while read out loud.


1. Use https://github.com/xanderstevenson/txt-2-mp3 - this will give you more control over the accent you want. When it's finished, upload the mp3 to your project folder in the this repo, under developer-hub and don't forget to attach it to your blog post.

2. If you save your .txt file in your project folder in developer-hub, it will automatically create an 'mp3s' folder in that directory, create your mp3 from the text and place it in there. Now, just download it and attach it to your blog post.



## Step 7

The Commit to main will notify those on the mailing list and and close the Asana task.
